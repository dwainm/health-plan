## Method

1. **Grill vegetables**: Preheat grill pan over medium-high. Grill fennel and red onion 6-10 minutes until crisp-tender, turning once.

2. **Chop**: Transfer vegetables to cutting board. Cool slightly and finely chop.

3. **Make filling**: In medium bowl, stir together beans, dates, lemon juice, cumin, paprika, and coriander. Mash beans with fork until chunky. Stir in chopped fennel and onion. Season with salt and pepper.

4. **Prep mushrooms**: Remove any stems from mushrooms.

5. **Stuff**: Spoon bean mixture into mushroom caps.

6. **Grill**: Grill stuffed mushrooms over medium-high 10-12 minutes until tender and they release most of their liquid.

7. **Garnish**: Top with fennel fronds and serve warm.

## Tips

**No grill pan?**: Bake stuffed mushrooms on a rimmed baking sheet at 400°F for 15 minutes or until tender.

**Fennel alternative**: Use celery if you can't find fennel.

**Make ahead**: Prep filling up to 1 day ahead, stuff and grill just before serving.

## Storage

- **Uncooked**: Stuff mushrooms up to 4 hours ahead, refrigerate
- **Cooked**: Best served immediately, but keep warm up to 30 minutes
