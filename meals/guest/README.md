# The 10 Guest Meals

For hosting and bringing food to others. These feel special without being stressful.

## Principles for Guest Meals

1. **Familiar flavors** — No "weird health food" signals
2. **Modular when possible** — Base + optional meat addition
3. **Make-ahead friendly** — Less stress day-of
4. **Travel well** — For bringing to others

## Category Breakdown

### One-Pot Meals (G1-G3)
Make ahead, reheat beautifully, serve with salad and bread.

### Modular/Build-Your-Own (G4-G6, G10)
Base is plant-based. Meat is optional addition. Everyone's happy.

### Soups (G7-G8)
Comforting, familiar, easy to transport. Always with good bread.

### Braai (G9)
Our default for South African hospitality. We bring the sides, others bring meat.

## The Modular Formula

```
BASE (plant-based, always)
├── Grain/starch (rice, couscous, bread)
├── Legumes or vegetables (filling, flavorful)
├── Sauces and toppings (tahini, salsa, chutney)
└── Salads and sides (abundant, colorful)

OPTIONAL ADD-ON
└── Meat or fish (grilled, on the side, for those who want)
```

## Rules for Guest Meals

1. Must be tested on family first
2. Must work with or without meat
3. Must be mostly make-ahead
4. Must not require exotic ingredients
5. No more than 10 total
