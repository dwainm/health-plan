A stunning tart that uses two types of sweet potatoes for a beautiful end result.

## Method

1. **Make crust**: Preheat oven to 400°F. In food processor, combine oats, flaxseed meal, almond butter, and 1¼ tsp pumpkin pie spice. Pulse until combined. With processor running, slowly add milk until mixture clings together and is slightly moistened. Press onto bottom and up sides of 10-inch tart pan. Bake 8 minutes. Remove and reduce oven to 350°F.

2. **Make orange sauce**: In small saucepan, combine orange juice, dates, and remaining ¼ tsp pumpkin pie spice. Bring to boiling; reduce to gentle boil 7-10 minutes until reduced by half (to ½ cup). Set aside 2 tablespoons.

3. **Make filling**: Combine mashed orange sweet potatoes, arrowroot powder, and 6 tablespoons orange sauce. Pour into partially baked crust.

4. **Bake**: Bake 35-45 minutes until filling is set, covering loosely with foil if needed to prevent overbrowning. Cool on wire rack.

5. **Steam purple potatoes**: Place slices in steamer basket over boiling water. Steam 3-5 minutes until tender.

6. **Decorate**: When tart is slightly cooled, arrange purple potato slices in concentric circles on top. Brush with reserved orange sauce. Sprinkle with almonds.

7. **Serve**: With Aquafaba Whipped Cream if desired.
