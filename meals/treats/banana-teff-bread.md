## Method

1. **Preheat**: Oven to 350°F (175°C). Line 8x4-inch loaf pan with parchment paper.

2. **Mash bananas**: In bowl, mash bananas with fork until mostly smooth.

3. **Wet ingredients**: Stir in plant milk, vinegar, and vanilla until well mixed.

4. **Dry ingredients**: In separate bowl, stir together teff flour, sugar, walnuts, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon, and salt.

5. **Combine**: Add wet mixture to dry ingredients. Gently fold until just combined—don't overmix.

6. **Bake**: Pour batter into prepared pan. Sprinkle raisins on top. Bake 40-45 minutes until toothpick inserted in center comes out clean.

7. **Cool**: Let loaf cool completely before slicing (this is important—teff bread slices better when fully cooled).

## Tips

**Teff flour**: Find it with gluten-free flours or grind whole teff seeds in blender/food processor

**Banana ripeness**: The browner the better—very ripe bananas add sweetness and moisture

**Don't overmix**: Stir just until combined for tender crumb

**Cool completely**: Teff bread firms up as it cools—slice after 1 hour cooling

## Variations

**Extra moist**: Add 2 tbsp applesauce to wet ingredients

**Different flours**: Try half teff + half oat flour

**More sweetness**: Add extra raisins or chopped dates to batter

**Nut-free**: Omit walnuts or use sunflower seeds

**Chocolate version**: Add 2 tbsp cocoa powder to dry ingredients
