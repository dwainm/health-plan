|------------|--------|-------|
| Rolled oats | 2 cups | Blend into flour, or use oat flour |
| Ripe banana | 2 medium | Provides sweetness and binding |

| Baking powder | 2 tsp | Fresh for best rise |
| Cinnamon | 1 tsp | |
| Vanilla extract | 1 tsp | |

### Method

2. **Rest**: Let batter sit 5 minutes while pan heats
