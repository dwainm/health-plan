3. **Preheat waffle maker**: Use medium-high setting if available. Lightly oil if needed.

5. **Serve**: Top with fresh berries, banana slices, and additional maple syrup.

## Tips for Success

**Don't peek**: Resist opening the waffle maker early—this is key to crispiness

**Texture**: Inside will look slightly moist but it's done when edges are crisp

**Sticking**: If waffles stick, let them cook longer or oil the waffle maker between batches

## Variations

**Extra crispy**: Press mixture thinner in the waffle maker

**Nutty**: Add 2 tbsp ground flaxseed to the mixture

**Apple pie**: Swap raisins for diced apple + ¼ tsp nutmeg
