## Dr. Greger's "A Better Breakfast" Smoothie Bowl

*Adapted from NutritionFacts.org*

**Serves 1**

### Ingredients

| Ingredient | Amount | Purpose |
|------------|--------|---------|
| Frozen blueberries | ½ cup | Antioxidants |
| Frozen mango pulp | ½ cup | Creaminess, sweetness |
| Ripe banana | 1 medium | Body, natural sweetness |
| Unsweetened soymilk | 1 cup | Protein, blendability |
| Ground flaxseeds | 1 tbsp | Omega-3, thickness |
| Rolled oats | ¼ cup | Sustained energy |
| Water | ¼ cup | Adjust consistency |

### Method

1. **Freeze fruit ahead**: Peel and freeze ripe bananas in chunks
2. **Blend**: Add all ingredients to high-speed blender
3. **Blend thick**: Use tamper or stop to scrape sides. Add liquid sparingly — you want it thick enough to eat with a spoon.
4. **Pour**: Into bowl immediately
5. **Top**: Add toppings right away (it melts fast)

*Dr. Greger's original includes white tea leaves and amla powder for maximum antioxidants — add if available.*

## Tips for Success

### Frozen Fruit is Essential

- Fresh fruit + ice = watery smoothie
- Frozen fruit = thick, ice cream-like texture
- Freeze your own ripe bananas — they're sweeter

### Blender Strategy

- High-speed blender works best
- Standard blender: Add liquid first, use pulse function
- Food processor works in a pinch

### Consistency

- Too thick? Add liquid 1 tbsp at a time
- Too thin? Add more frozen fruit or oats
- Should be thick enough to hold toppings without sinking

---

## Lower Calorie Adjustments

| Standard | Lower Calorie Swap |
|----------|-------------------|
| Full banana | ½ banana + extra ice |
| Nut toppings | Seed toppings (hemp, chia) |
| Regular plant milk | Unsweetened almond milk (lowest cal) |
| 2 tbsp granola | 1 tbsp + extra fruit |
