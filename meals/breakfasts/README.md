## Breakfast Principles

1. **Whole grains always** — Oats, whole wheat, no refined flour
2. **Plant-based by default** — No eggs, dairy, or meat required
3. **Low calorie density** — Large portions that fill you up
4. **Minimal added oils** — Use fruit, nuts, and seeds for healthy fats
5. **Prep ahead when possible** — Overnight oats, frozen smoothie packs
