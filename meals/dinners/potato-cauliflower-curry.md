## Method

1. **Steam cauliflower**: Place in steamer basket over boiling water. Cover and steam 5 minutes until crisp-tender. Transfer to bowl.

2. **Steam potatoes**: Add to same steamer basket, cover, and steam 10 minutes until tender. Add to bowl with cauliflower. Drain water from pan.

3. **Make sauce**: In blender, combine onion, tomato paste, curry powder, ginger, cumin seeds, garlic, and 1 cup water. Blend until smooth.

4. **Cook sauce**: Transfer to skillet. Stir in 1 more cup water. Bring to boil, reduce to medium-high, cook 5-7 minutes. Reduce to medium-low, cook 10 minutes until sauce darkens in color.

5. **Combine**: Add steamed vegetables, peas, ground cashews, lime juice, and cayenne to sauce. Cook 5-7 minutes until sauce is absorbed by vegetables, stirring occasionally. Add water if needed for desired consistency. Season with salt.

6. **Serve**: Over brown rice, sprinkled with cilantro.

## Tips

**Cutting vegetables**: Keep potato pieces larger than cauliflower—they take longer to cook

**Sauce consistency**: Add water ¼ cup at a time if too thick

**Spice level**: Start with mild curry powder, add cayenne to taste

**Cashew substitute**: Use sunflower seeds or omit for nut-free version (sauce will be less creamy)

## Variations

**Extra vegetables**: Add carrots or bell peppers with the potatoes

**Creamier**: Add ¼ cup coconut milk with the cashews

**Extra protein**: Stir in 1 can chickpeas with the peas

**Different rice**: Try basmati, quinoa, or cauliflower rice
