## Method

1. **Roast tomatoes**: Preheat oven to 450°F. Line a 15x10-inch baking pan with parchment paper. Spread tomatoes in prepared pan. Roast 10-12 minutes or until lightly browned and skins begin to pop. Season with black pepper.

2. **Cook pasta**: Cook pasta according to package directions; drain. Return pasta to pot. Add Queso Sauce; toss to coat, adding water, 1 Tbsp. at a time, as needed to make creamy.

3. **Sauté vegetables**: Meanwhile, in an extra-large nonstick skillet cook mushrooms, bell pepper, onion, and garlic over medium heat for 5 minutes or until tender and any liquid has evaporated, stirring occasionally.

4. **Assemble**: Spoon pasta mixture into bowls. Top with mushroom mixture and tomatoes. Sprinkle with basil and Aleppo pepper.

## Tips

**Queso Sauce**: This recipe uses Forks Over Knives' Vegan Queso Sauce. Make it ahead or use a store-bought version.

**Aleppo Pepper**: This Middle Eastern spice adds heat and subtle sweetness. If unavailable, substitute with a pinch of red pepper flakes and a dash of paprika.

**Mushrooms**: Use a mix of cremini, shiitake, or oyster for more flavor depth.
