4. **Add aromatics**: Garlic, ginger, cook 1 minute

### Build
5. **Return meat** to pot

7. **Deglaze**: Red wine, scrape bottom
8. **Add liquid**: Stock and chakalaka soup
9. **Layer vegetables**:
   - Sweet potato slices
   - Carrot slices
   - Baby potatoes on top

### Cook
10. **Pressure cooker**: 35 minutes high pressure, natural release 10 min
11. **OR slow cook**: 6-8 hours on low
12. **OR stovetop**: Simmer covered 2.5-3 hours

## Serving

- Serve with crusty bread or rice
- Green salad on the side cuts the richness

## Notes

- Lamb needs 20 minutes more than beef—if using pressure cooker, add lamb first, then beef
- The thinly sliced vegetables dissolve into the sauce, thickening it
- Chakalaka soup adds heat and complexity—substitute tomato soup + paprika if unavailable
