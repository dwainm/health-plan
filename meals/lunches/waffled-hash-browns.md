**Plant-based | Creative | Waffle iron | Savory**

The golden brown grids hold a saucy bean and kale topping that transforms this simple dish into a satisfying main course.

## Method

### Make the Bean Topping

1. **Simmer base**: In medium saucepan, combine sliced onion, tomato paste, thyme, bay leaf, 1 minced garlic clove, cayenne, and 1½ cups water. Bring to boil, reduce heat, simmer uncovered 15 minutes.

2. **Add greens and beans**: Add kale and beans, cook 10 minutes more. Remove thyme sprigs and bay leaf.

### Make the Hash Browns

3. **Shred vegetables**: Place clean dish towel on counter. Using large holes of box grater, shred remaining onion, potato, carrot, and turnip onto the towel.

4. **Squeeze**: Gather towel ends, hold over sink, and twist tightly to squeeze all excess moisture from vegetables.

5. **Season**: Transfer to bowl, stir in remaining 2 minced garlic cloves and parsley.

6. **Waffle**: Preheat waffle maker on medium-high. Spoon vegetable mixture into waffle maker, gently packing it in. Close lid without locking, cook 10-15 minutes until golden brown.

7. **Serve**: Top with spicy bean mixture.

## Tips

**Root veggie swaps**: Use sweet potato instead of russet, or parsnips instead of carrot/turnip

**Beet warning**: If using beet, use an older dish towel you don't mind staining

**Spice level**: Add extra red pepper flakes for more heat

## Variations

**Extra crispy**: Cook hash browns a few minutes longer

**Different beans**: Use navy beans or great northern beans

**Herbs**: Try fresh rosemary or sage instead of thyme

---

## Storage

- **Bean topping**: Up to 3 days refrigerated
