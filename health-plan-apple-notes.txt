HEALTH PLAN

"Do everything as unto Him. This world will pass."

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
PRINCIPLES
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

1. FIRST THINGS FIRST
   This world will pass. Do everything as unto Him.

2. CALORIE DENSITY
   Eat foods that fill you up with fewer calories.
   Starches, vegetables, legumes. Not oil, meat, processed food.

3. PLANT-BASED BY DEFAULT
   Daily meals center on whole grains, beans, vegetables.
   Meat is a condiment, not the center.

4. THE 30 + 10
   Thirty meals for daily life. Ten for guests.
   No more. No novelty hunting.

5. RESISTANCE FIRST
   Build muscle, raise BMR.
   Cardio for heart and enjoyment, not weight loss.

6. WHOLE GRAINS ALWAYS
   Brown rice, whole wheat, oats.
   More filling, same calories.

7. SIMPLICITY IN SHOPPING
   Eighty percent the same every week.
   No exotic ingredients.

8. HOSPITALITY WITHOUT COMPROMISE
   Serve guests well. Keep your defaults as the base.

9. THE LONG GAME
   Build a food culture, not a diet.
   Consistency beats intensity.

10. GRACE OVER PERFECTION
    Miss a day? Start again at the next meal.
