# Health Plan

> A simple, sustainable approach to nutrition and health built around a monthly meal rotation system. The plan emphasizes calorie density, plant-based eating by default, resistance training, whole grains, and grace over perfection. Designed for a family of 6 with automatic, repeatable meals that scale.

## Overview

The Health Plan is built on constraint as freedom. Daily meals are automatic, boring, and effective. Special meals are reserved for guests, celebrations, and occasions. The entire system centers on 30 core recipes (22 meals) that rotate monthly, making meal planning effortless.

Key principles:
- Calorie density over calorie counting
- Plant-based by default (meat as condiment, not centerpiece)  
- Whole grains always (same calories, more filling)
- Resistance training over cardio
- Grace over perfection
