**Total dough weight:** ~1970g

## Timeline

| Time | Step |
|------|------|

| 1:30 | First fold |
| 2:00 | Second fold |

## Method

### 1. Autolyse (1 hour)

Mix 800g whole wheat flour + 200g bread flour with 750g warm water.

Stir until no dry flour remains. Cover and rest.

*This hydrates the flour, starts enzyme activity.*

### 2. Add Starter and Salt (1 hour into autolyse)

Add 200g active starter. Squeeze and fold into dough until incorporated.

Add 20g salt. Squeeze and fold until dissolved.

Cover and rest 30 minutes.

### 3. Bulk Fermentation and Folds (3 hours)

Every 30 minutes, perform a **stretch and fold:**

1. Wet your hand
2. Grab one side of dough, stretch up, fold over center
3. Rotate bowl 90°, repeat
4. Do this 4 times (one full rotation)

**4 sets total:** at 1:30, 2:00, 2:30, and 3:00 hours from mixing.

Dough should feel stronger, smoother, hold shape better with each fold.

### 4. Pre-shape (4 hours from mixing)

Turn dough onto lightly floured counter.

Divide in half (or thirds for smaller loaves).

Gently shape each into a round. Let rest 30 minutes.

### 5. Final Shape (4.5 hours from mixing)

Shape into tight rounds or oblongs.

Place seam-side up in floured proofing baskets (or bowls lined with floured towels).

### 6. Cold Proof (5 hours from mixing, overnight)

Cover and refrigerate 12-24 hours.

*Cold proof develops flavor, makes scoring easier, fits our schedule.*

### 7. Bake (Next Morning)

**Preheat:**
- Oven to 250°C (480°F)
- Dutch oven inside (if using)

**Prepare:**
- Turn dough out onto parchment paper
- Score top with sharp knife or lame (one deep slash, or decorative pattern)

**Bake:**
- 20 minutes covered (creates steam for crust)
- Remove lid, reduce to 230°C (450°F)
- 25-30 minutes uncovered (develops color)
- Internal temp should reach 98°C (208°F)

**Cool:**
- At least 1 hour before slicing
- Steam inside continues cooking

## Storage

| Method | Duration |
|--------|----------|
| Paper bag, room temp | 3-4 days |
| Cut side down on board | 2 days (cut surface stays fresh) |
| Slice and freeze | 1 month |

## Variations

| Variation | Modification |
|-----------|--------------|
| Seeded | Add 100g mixed seeds (soaked 1 hour) with salt |
| Oat porridge | Replace 100g water with 100g cooked oatmeal |
| Rye blend | Replace 200g wheat with rye flour |
| Olive | Add 150g chopped olives with salt |

## Family Notes

- **Smaller loaves** are easier to slice and handle
- **Seeded version** is best for sandwiches
- **Plain version** is best for toast and soup
- Freeze one loaf immediately, eat one fresh
