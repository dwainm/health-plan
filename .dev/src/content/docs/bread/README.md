Whole grain sourdough for daily life. Simple, nutritious, satisfying.

## Why Sourdough

| Factor | Commercial Yeast Bread | Sourdough |
|--------|------------------------|-----------|
| Digestibility | Harder to digest | Fermentation breaks down gluten |
| Glycemic index | Higher spike | Lower, slower release |
| Preservation | Mold in days | Lasts a week |
| Flavor | Bland | Complex, satisfying |
| Cost | Store-bought expensive | Flour + water + time |

## Why Whole Grain

- **Satiety:** 2 slices whole grain = 3-4 slices white
- **Nutrients:** Fiber, B vitamins, minerals intact
- **Calorie density:** Fuller on fewer calories

Stone-ground whole grain flour is best. Industrial roller-milled loses some benefit.

## Our Two Breads

### 1. Everyday Whole Grain Sourdough Loaf

The daily bread. Sandwich slices, toast, soup accompaniment.

### 2. Whole Grain Baguettes

For guests, for braai, for feeling fancy. Same dough, different shape.

## Equipment Needed

| Essential | Nice to Have |
|-----------|--------------|
| Digital scale | Dutch oven |
| Large mixing bowl | Banneton (proofing basket) |
| Clean kitchen towels | Lame (scoring tool) |
| Baking stone or steel | |

## The Rhythm

```
Friday evening:   Feed starter
Saturday morning: Mix dough
Saturday evening: Shape and cold proof
Sunday morning:   Bake
```

One bake = bread for the week.

## Starter Maintenance

Keep it simple:

- **In the fridge:** Feed once a week
- **On the counter:** Feed daily (only if baking frequently)
- **Discard:** Use in pancakes, crackers, or compost

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Likely Cause | Fix |
|---------|--------------|-----|
| Dense, gummy | Underproofed | Let it rise longer |
| Flat, spread out | Overproofed | Proof less time, or colder |
| Too sour | Long cold proof | Shorten refrigeration |
| Not rising | Weak starter | Feed more regularly |
