## Core Principles

### Calorie Density Is the Key
We don't count calories. We choose foods that fill us up with fewer calories automatically.

| Eat More (Low Density) | Eat Less (High Density) |
|------------------------|------------------------|
| Vegetables, fruits | Oil, butter |
| Starches (potatoes, rice, beans) | Meat, cheese |
| Legumes, lentils | Processed snacks |
| Soups, stews | Fried foods |

### Plant-Based by Default
Daily meals center on whole grains, legumes, vegetables, and starches. Meat is a condiment, a celebration—not the plate's center.

### The Meal System
**Constraint is freedom.**
- **Daily meals** — automatic, boring, effective
- **Special meals** — for guests, celebrations, and special occasions

No more. New recipes only by deliberate choice.

### Resistance Training Over Cardio
Muscle burns calories at rest. Cardio burns calories only while doing it.

### Whole Grains, Always
Same calories on paper. Fewer calories in practice because you get full faster.

### Grace Over Perfection
Miss a day? Eat the wrong thing? Start again at the next meal. No guilt, no spiral. This is a direction, not a destination.
