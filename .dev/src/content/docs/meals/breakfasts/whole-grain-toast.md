## The Bread

Use **100% whole grain bread** — sourdough preferred for digestibility and flavor.

- Homemade sourdough (see [bread recipes](../../bread/))
- Store-bought: Look for "100% whole wheat" as first ingredient
- Ezekiel bread (sprouted whole grains)
- Avoid: "Wheat bread" (often white flour with caramel coloring)

## Lower Calorie Modifications

To reduce calories while staying satisfied:

1. **Use 1 slice toast** + load up on vegetables
2. **Thin spread** of nut butter (1 tsp instead of 1 tbsp)
3. **Bulk with veggies**: Tomato, cucumber, arugula, sprouts, mushrooms
4. **Skip oil-based spreads**: Use hummus, mashed beans, or smashed avocado

---

## Quick Assembly

**Weekday rush version:**
1. Toast bread while gathering toppings
2. Prep toppings while toast is toasting
3. Assemble and eat

**Total time: 5 minutes**

---

## Batch Prep

- Slice and freeze homemade bread
- Pre-portion nut butters in small containers
- Wash and prep vegetables on Sunday
- Make oil-free hummus in batch

---

## Notes

- **Nut butters**: Choose varieties with only nuts and salt — no added oils or sugar
- **Hummus**: Make your own without tahini to reduce calories, or use sparingly
- **Avocado**: High calorie but nutrient-dense; use ¼-½ avocado per serving
- **Nutritional yeast**: Adds cheesy, savory flavor without dairy

*These toppings align with Dr. Greger's Daily Dozen and Forks Over Knives principles.*
