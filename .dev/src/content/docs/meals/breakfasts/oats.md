## Peanut Butter Banana Power Bowl

**Serves 1 | ~500 calories | Ready in 10 minutes**

This is our go-to high-energy breakfast. The peanut butter and banana combo is addictive, naturally sweet, and keeps you full for hours.

### Ingredients

| Ingredient | Amount | Notes |
|------------|--------|-------|
| Rolled oats (old-fashioned) | ½ cup | Not instant—better texture |
| Unsweetened almond milk | 1 cup | Or any milk you prefer |
| Water | ½ cup | For creaminess |
| Ripe banana, mashed | 1 medium | Plus extra slices for topping |
| Natural peanut butter | 2 tbsp | ~190 calories of flavor |
| Maple syrup or honey | 1 tbsp | Start here, adjust to taste |
| Cinnamon | ½ tsp | Warm, flavorful depth |
| Salt | pinch | Enhances everything |
| **Optional boosts** | | |
| Chia seeds | 1 tbsp | +60 cal, omega-3s, creaminess |
| Chopped walnuts | 1 tbsp | +80 cal, crunch |

### Method

1. **Toast oats** (optional but recommended): Heat dry pot over medium heat. Add oats and toast 2-3 minutes, stirring occasionally, until fragrant and lightly golden. This deepens the flavor.
2. **Combine base**: Add almond milk, water, mashed banana, cinnamon, and salt to the pot with toasted oats
3. **Cook**: Bring to gentle boil, reduce to low, simmer 5-8 minutes until thick and creamy. Stir occasionally. Add splash more liquid if too thick.
4. **Enrich**: Remove from heat. Stir in peanut butter and maple syrup until fully melted and incorporated—this makes it velvety.
5. **Taste**: Adjust sweetness if needed (banana keeps it naturally sweet)
6. **Top**: Spoon into bowl. Add banana slices, drizzle of extra peanut butter, sprinkle of cinnamon, and any nuts/chia for crunch.

## Microwave Apple-Carrot Base (Quick Method)

**Serves 1 | Adds 3 minutes | Extra fiber & sweetness**

Grating and pre-cooking apple and carrot breaks down cell walls, releasing natural sugars and making them tender before adding to oats. This creates a sweeter, more cohesive bowl without added sugar.

### Ingredients

| Ingredient | Amount | Notes |
|------------|--------|-------|
| Apple (any variety) | 1 small | Grated or finely chopped |
| Carrot | 1 small | Grated |
| Water | 2 tbsp | For steaming |

### Method

1. **Grate**: Use box grater or food processor to grate apple and carrot (no need to peel)
2. **Microwave**: Place grated apple, carrot, and 2 tbsp water in microwave-safe bowl. Cover and microwave on high for 2-3 minutes until soft and fragrant
3. **Add to pot**: Stir microwaved mixture into your oats during the last 2-3 minutes of cooking
4. **Benefits**: 
   - Natural sweetness reduces need for added sugar
   - Pre-cooked vegetables blend into creamy texture
   - Extra fiber and nutrients from whole produce

### Flavor Combinations

**Classic**: Add cinnamon + vanilla + walnuts
**Tropical**: Add coconut flakes + chopped dates
**Spiced**: Add ginger + nutmeg + pecans
