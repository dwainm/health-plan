## Method

1. **Cook mushrooms**: In extra-large oven-safe skillet, cook mushrooms over medium-high 6-8 minutes until lightly browned and liquid has evaporated, stirring occasionally and adding water 1-2 tablespoons at a time as needed. (If using oil: Heat oil first, then add mushrooms.)

2. **Make chorizo mixture**: In large bowl, stir together chili powder, ancho powder, cumin, oregano, coriander, garlic powder, paprika, and cinnamon. In food processor, combine mushrooms, chickpeas, walnuts, and lime juice. Pulse until chopped. Add to seasonings; stir well. Let stand.

3. **Steam vegetables**: Place potatoes and onion in steamer basket in large saucepan. Add water to just below basket. Bring to boiling. Cover and steam 12-14 minutes until tender.
