**Plant-based | One-pot | Batch cooking | Family-friendly**

A hearty, satisfying pasta sauce that's packed with vegetables and red lentils. This is not a meat imitation—it's delicious in its own right. The lentils create a thick, meaty texture while the mirepoix (onion, celery, carrot) builds deep flavor.

## Method

1. **Sauté vegetables**: Heat olive oil in large skillet or Dutch oven. Add onion, celery, and carrot. Cook 5-10 minutes until softened.

2. **Add aromatics**: Stir in garlic, cook 30 seconds until fragrant.

3. **Bloom tomato paste**: Stir in tomato paste, cook 1 minute.

4. **Add tomatoes and seasonings**: Add tomato sauce, diced tomatoes with juice, basil, oregano, baking soda, and salt/pepper.

5. **Add lentils**: Stir in red lentils and water.

6. **Simmer**: Cook 20-30 minutes, stirring regularly, until lentils are tender and sauce is thick. It will look loose at first but thickens as lentils absorb liquid.

## Tips

**Lentil texture**: Red lentils cook fastest and break down into a thick sauce. Green/brown lentils work but stay firmer—add 10 min cook time.

**Too thick?**: Add splashes of water or pasta cooking water

**Baking soda**: This is the secret to cutting tomato acidity without sugar. Don't skip it.

**Make it richer**: Add ½ cup red wine with the tomatoes (simmer 2 min before adding lentils)
