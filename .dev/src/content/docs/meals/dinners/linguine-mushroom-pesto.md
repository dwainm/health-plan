**Plant-based | 25 minutes | Italian-inspired | 30-minute meal**

Fresh, filling, and full of flavor—this easy linguine comes together in just 25 minutes. Sautéed mushrooms are blended with basil, garlic, and walnuts to create an umami-rich pesto that's thicker and chunkier than traditional herb-based pesto. Tossed with whole wheat noodles and topped with lemony white beans and arugula for extra substance.

## Method

1. **Cook pasta**: Cook pasta according to package directions. Reserve ½ cup pasta cooking water. Drain and return to pot.

2. **Sauté mushrooms**: Meanwhile, in extra-large nonstick skillet, cook mushrooms and garlic over medium-high 5 minutes until tender and liquid evaporates, stirring occasionally.

3. **Make pesto**: Transfer mushroom mixture to food processor. Add basil, broth, walnuts, salt, pepper, and 1 tablespoon lemon juice. Pulse until uniformly blended.

4. **Make topping**: In bowl, combine beans, arugula, lemon zest, and remaining 2 tablespoons lemon juice. Season with additional salt and pepper.

5. **Toss and serve**: Toss mushroom pesto with pasta to coat, adding reserved pasta water a little at a time as needed to make creamy. Serve topped with bean mixture.
