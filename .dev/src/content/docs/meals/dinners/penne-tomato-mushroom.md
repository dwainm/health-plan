## Method

1. **Cook pasta**: Bring large pot of water to boil. Cook penne according to package instructions. Drain well and set aside.

2. **Sauté vegetables**: Meanwhile, sauté onions and mushrooms in large saucepan over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until onions turn brown and translucent, 7-8 minutes. Add water 1-2 tablespoons at a time as needed to prevent sticking.

3. **Add aromatics**: Add garlic and thyme; cook 1 minute.

4. **Simmer sauce**: Add crushed tomatoes with their juice; simmer, stirring occasionally, for 10 minutes.

5. **Combine**: Add plant milk, cooked pasta, and basil; season with salt and pepper. Toss until well coated. Cook until heated through, about 1 minute.

6. **Serve**: Serve hot.
