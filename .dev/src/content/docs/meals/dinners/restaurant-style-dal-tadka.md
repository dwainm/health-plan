## Method

### 1. Cook the Dal
Pressure cook or simmer the dal with water, turmeric, and salt until super soft — it should break apart easily when stirred (about 20 minutes pressure cooker, 45 minutes stovetop). Whisk to a smooth consistency.

### 2. Build the Flavor Base
Heat oil/ghee in a large pan. Add cumin seeds and let them sizzle. Add onions and cook until golden brown (8-10 minutes). Add garlic, ginger, and green chilies — cook 2 minutes. Add tomatoes and salt, cook until softened (5 minutes). Stir in garam masala, coriander powder, and Kashmiri chili powder. Cook 2 minutes.

### 3. Combine
Add the cooked dal to the masala base. Mix well and simmer 10 minutes to blend flavors. Add water if too thick.

### 4. Secret Smoky Step (Dhungar)
Heat a small piece of charcoal until glowing red-hot (over direct flame). Place it in a small heatproof bowl in the center of the dal pot. Drizzle oil over the hot charcoal — it will smoke immediately. Cover tightly with a lid immediately. Let smoke infuse for 3 minutes (don't overdo it). Remove bowl and discard charcoal.

### 5. Finish
Stir in lemon juice, crushed kasuri methi, and fresh coriander.

### 6. Final Tadka
In a small pan, heat oil/ghee. Add cumin seeds, sliced garlic, green chilies, asafoetida, and Kashmiri chili powder. Let it sizzle and become aromatic (30 seconds). Pour this hot tempering over the dal.

### 7. Serve
Garnish with more fresh coriander. Serve hot with rice, roti, or naan.

## Tips

**Dal consistency**: Restaurant dal is thinner than home-style. Add hot water to adjust.

**The holy trinity**: Don't skip garlic, ginger, and green chilies — they build the foundation.

**Kasuri methi**: Crushing the dried leaves releases their aroma. This is essential for that restaurant flavor.

**Don't skip the smoke**: The dhungar method is what makes this taste like restaurant dal. Use natural wood charcoal, not briquettes.

**Tadka timing**: Pour the hot tadka over the dal just before serving for maximum aroma.

**Make ahead**: Cook the dal base ahead. Do dhungar and tadka just before serving.

## Variations

**Different lentils**: Use masoor dal (red lentils) for faster cooking, or a mix of toor and moong dal.

**Extra richness**: Stir in 2 tbsp cream or coconut cream at the end.

**No charcoal**: Use liquid smoke (½ tsp) or smoked paprika as a shortcut.

**Extra heat**: Add more green chilies or a pinch of cayenne.
