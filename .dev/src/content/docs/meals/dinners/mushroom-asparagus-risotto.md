**Plant-based | Gluten-free | Italian | Comfort food**

Umami-rich mushrooms and earthy asparagus are the dream team in this classic Italian rice dish. Fragrant garlic, bright lemon juice, and herbaceous dill create rich flavor. Wholesome brown rice replaces traditional Arborio and soaks up savory veggie stock and white wine until every grain becomes deliciously tender.

## Method

1. **Warm broth**: In medium saucepan, combine broth and 3 cups water. Bring to boiling; reduce heat to keep warm.

2. **Sauté vegetables**: In 4- to 5-quart Dutch oven, cook mushrooms, onion, and garlic over medium 5-6 minutes, stirring occasionally and adding hot broth 1-2 tablespoons at a time as needed to prevent sticking.

3. **Add wine**: Add wine; cook 1-2 minutes until evaporated. Add rice; cook 1-2 minutes until rice smells nutty.

4. **Cook risotto**: Add ½ cup hot broth to rice mixture; stir frequently until absorbed. Continue adding broth in ½-cup increments until rice is nearly tender, about 45 minutes.

5. **Add asparagus**: Add asparagus; cook 3-5 minutes more until rice and asparagus are tender.

6. **Finish**: Stir in lemon juice, dill, salt, and pepper. Sprinkle with nutritional yeast if using. Serve with lemon wedges.

## Tips

**Mushroom variety**: Use any combination of mushrooms you have available

**Make it your own**: Add spinach or kale at the end for extra greens

**Stir constantly**: This releases the starch and creates creaminess
