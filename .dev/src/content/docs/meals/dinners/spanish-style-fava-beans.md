**Plant-based | 25 minutes | Gluten-free | One-pot | Spanish**

Smoked paprika gives this classic dish an unmistakably smoky flavor, while fresh Roma tomatoes combine with onion and garlic to create an aromatic tomato sauce. This vegan version skips the ham in favor of tender, sweet green peas. Serve over brown rice or barley for a hearty meal, or skip the rice for a tapas-style dish with crusty bread.

## Method

1. **Sauté onion**: In a large skillet, cook onion over medium heat for 3 minutes or until tender, stirring occasionally and adding water 1-2 tablespoons at a time as needed to prevent sticking.

2. **Add aromatics**: Stir in garlic and smoked paprika. Cook and stir for 1 minute.

3. **Simmer**: Stir in peas, tomatoes, beans, and broth. Bring to boiling; reduce heat. Simmer, uncovered, for 5 minutes or until tomatoes are broken down and mixture is saucy, stirring occasionally.

4. **Finish**: Stir in parsley, vinegar, and pepper.

5. **Serve**: Serve over hot cooked brown rice or barley.

## Tips

**Bean substitutes**: Canned favas can be hard to find. Substitute butter beans, broad beans, lima beans, or even edamame.

**Gluten note**: If gluten is a concern, serve over brown rice, as barley contains gluten.

**Make it a tapas**: Skip the rice and serve with crusty bread for a Spanish-style appetizer.
