## Method

1. **Make spice mix**: In small bowl, stir together cumin, salt, ginger, turmeric, cayenne, and cinnamon. Set aside.

2. **Preheat**: Oven to 375°F (190°C).

3. **Boil rice and vegetables**: In 6-qt Dutch oven, bring 10 cups water to boil. Stir in rice, return to boil, reduce heat. Simmer 15 minutes. Add potatoes, simmer 10 minutes. Add cauliflower and carrot, simmer 2 minutes more. Vegetables will still be crisp. Drain and return to Dutch oven.

4. **Combine**: Stir in chickpeas, tomato sauce, diced tomatoes, and peas. Add spice mix and stir well.

5. **Bake**: Spread into 3-qt baking dish. Cover and bake 25-30 minutes until heated through and vegetables are tender.

6. **Rest**: Let stand 10 minutes before serving. Top with cilantro if desired.

## Tips

**Cutting vegetables**: Keep potato pieces uniform—they take longest to cook

**Spice level**: Start with ⅛ tsp cayenne, add more if you like heat

**Make it creamier**: Stir in ½ cup coconut milk with the tomato sauce

**Don't skip the rest**: The 10-minute rest helps flavors meld and makes serving easier

## Variations

**Extra vegetables**: Add bell peppers or green beans with the cauliflower

**Different grain**: Use quinoa (reduce initial cooking to 10 minutes)

**More protein**: Add extra can of chickpeas or 1 cup cooked lentils

**Toppings**: Try toasted cashews, raisins, or a dollop of coconut yogurt
