**Plant-based | 50 minutes | Baked (not fried) | Middle Eastern**

These baked falafels taste just as good as the fried original, without all the added fat. Enjoy them as an appetizer, in a pita with sauce, or even on pizza. They're crispy on the outside, tender on the inside, and packed with flavor from fresh parsley and aromatic spices.
