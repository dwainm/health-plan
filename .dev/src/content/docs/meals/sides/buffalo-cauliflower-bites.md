## Method

1. **Preheat**: Oven to 450°F (230°C). Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper.

2. **Make batter**: In blender, combine brown rice flour, almond flour, tomato paste, garlic powder, onion powder, smoked paprika, parsley, and ⅔ cup water. Blend until smooth and thick.

3. **Coat cauliflower**: Transfer batter to large bowl. Add cauliflower florets and toss until well coated.

4. **Arrange**: Place florets in single layer on prepared baking sheets, making sure they don't touch each other.

5. **Bake**: 20-25 minutes until crisp on edges. They won't be crispy all over while still in the oven.

6. **Crisp**: Remove from oven and let stand 3 minutes to crisp up more.

7. **Sauce**: Transfer to bowl and drizzle with hot sauce or barbecue sauce. Serve immediately.

## Tips for Success

**Don't crowd**: Florets need space to crisp—use 2 baking sheets if needed

**Batter thickness**: Should be thick but pourable—add splash more water if too thick

**Crispiness**: They crisp more after coming out of the oven, so don't overbake

**Sauce timing**: Toss with sauce at the last minute—coated bites get softer quickly

---

## Variations

**Sweet & spicy**: Mix 2 tbsp hot sauce + 2 tbsp barbecue sauce

**Air fryer**: Cook at 400°F for 12-15 minutes, shaking basket halfway

**Different veggies**: Try broccoli, zucchini, or green beans

**Dipping**: Serve with ranch dressing, Caesar dressing, or spinach ranch dip

---

## Storage

- **Best fresh**: These are crispiest right out of the oven
- **Refrigerate**: 2 days (will be softer)
- **Reheat**: Air fryer 5 minutes at 400°F to re-crisp
- **Don't freeze**: Texture suffers
