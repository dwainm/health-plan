1. **Mash**: In large bowl, mash bananas with fork.

2. **Mix**: Add cocoa powder, plant milk, maple syrup, vanilla, and peppermint (if using). Mash and stir to combine.

3. **Add oats**: Stir in oats and mix well. If mixture is too runny, refrigerate 15-30 minutes to help set.

4. **Prepare**: Line baking sheet with waxed or parchment paper. Place cereal in small bowl.

7. **Store**: Transfer to airtight container and store in freezer.
