## Method

1. **Soften**: Remove mango from freezer and let stand 10 minutes to soften slightly.

2. **Blend**: Transfer mango and banana to food processor. Pulse until broken into small pieces, then continue processing until smooth and creamy.

3. **Serve**: Immediately for soft-serve texture, or transfer to freezer container and freeze until ready to serve.

4. **Top**: With additional mango chunks and sprinkle with cardamom or paprika if desired.

## Tips

**Fresh mango**: If using fresh, peel and cut into chunks, freeze at least 6 hours or overnight before using

**Texture**: The 10-minute rest is crucial—too frozen and it won't blend smoothly

**Variations**: Try different frozen fruits like pineapple, berries, or peaches
