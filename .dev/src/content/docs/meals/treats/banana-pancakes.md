## Method

1. **Mix dry**: In bowl, combine flour, baking powder, salt, and egg replacer.

2. **Mix wet**: In separate bowl, mash bananas well. Stir in plant milk and sparkling water.

3. **Combine**: Pour wet into dry ingredients. Stir to combine, being careful not to overmix. Batter will be slightly lumpy.

4. **Cook**: Heat nonstick griddle over medium heat. Pour ¼ cup batter per pancake. Flatten slightly with measuring cup bottom.

5. **Flip**: When bubbles appear and edges turn golden, flip and cook until browned on both sides.

6. **Serve**: Hot, topped with blueberries or your favorite toppings.

## Tips

**Consistency**: For thinner pancakes, add more plant milk. For thicker, use only ½ cup sparkling water initially.

**Don't overmix**: Some lumps are okay—overmixing makes tough pancakes

**Heat level**: Medium heat is key—too hot and they'll burn outside before cooking through

## Variations

**Add-ins**: Fold in chocolate chips, nuts, or different fruits

**Spices**: Add 1 tsp cinnamon or nutmeg to dry ingredients

**Gluten-free**: Use gluten-free flour blend
