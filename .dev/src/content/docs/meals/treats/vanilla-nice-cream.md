## Tips

**Banana ripeness**: Freeze bananas when very ripe for sweetest results

**Texture**: Don't add too much milk—start with ¼ cup and add only as needed

**Vanilla extract substitute**: Use 1 tbsp vanilla extract if you don't have vanilla bean

**Ice crystals**: To minimize, press plastic wrap directly onto surface of nice cream before freezing
