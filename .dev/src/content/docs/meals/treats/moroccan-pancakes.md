## Method

### Make the Pancakes

1. **Activate yeast**: In large bowl, combine 1 cup warm water, yeast, and ½ tsp date paste. Cover with cloth; let stand 10 minutes until frothy.

2. **Make batter**: Stir in remaining ¾ cup almond milk and ½ cup water. In separate bowl, mix whole wheat flour, oat flour, baking powder, and salt. Add flour mixture to yeast mixture; whisk until smooth. Cover; let stand in warm place 20 minutes.

3. **Cook pancakes**: Preheat nonstick skillet over medium-low 3 minutes. Pour ⅓ cup batter in center; spread into 5-inch round using crepe spreader or spatula. Cook 2-3 minutes until underside is lightly browned. Flip; cook 2-3 minutes more until golden. Keep warm in 200°F oven while making remaining pancakes.

### Make the Sauce

4. **Blend sauce**: In blender, combine bananas, ¾ cup almond milk, date paste, cocoa powder, and vanilla. Blend until smooth.

5. **Serve**: Drizzle warm pancakes with chocolate banana sauce.

## Tips

**Batter consistency**: Should be thin and pourable—spread easily in pan

**Spreading**: Use back of spoon or crepe spreader to make thin, even rounds

**Cooking temperature**: Medium-low is key—too hot and they'll burn before cooking through

**Keep warm**: Stack pancakes on baking sheet in low oven while cooking the rest

---

## Variations

**Toppings**: Fresh berries, chopped nuts, or coconut flakes

**Roll-ups**: Spread with sauce, roll like a taquito, drizzle with more sauce

**Gluten-free**: Use all oat flour or buckwheat flour

**Less sweet**: Reduce date paste in sauce to 1 tbsp

## Storage

- **Batter**: Can be made ahead, refrigerate up to 24 hours
- **Cooked pancakes**: Refrigerate 3 days, freeze up to 1 month
- **Sauce**: Best fresh, but keeps 2 days refrigerated
- **Reheat**: Warm pancakes in skillet or toaster
