## Method

1. **Prep filling**: In a microwave-safe bowl, stir together beans, corn, taco seasoning, and ¼ cup water.

2. **Microwave filling**: Cover and microwave 4-6 minutes or until heated through, stirring once. Lightly mash mixture to the texture of chunky refried beans, leaving some beans whole.

3. **Warm tortillas**: Wrap tortillas in a damp kitchen towel; microwave 1-2 minutes or until hot and pliable.

4. **Assemble**: Divide bean mixture among tortillas. Top with lettuce, pico de gallo, and avocado.

5. **Serve**: Serve immediately while warm.

## Stovetop Method

If you prefer not to use a microwave:
- Heat bean mixture in a small saucepan with 2-3 tbsp water over medium heat
- Warm tortillas directly over a gas burner or in a dry skillet

## Tips

**Make your own seasoning**: Combine cumin, chili powder, garlic powder, and oregano.

**Add-ins**: Sautéed bell peppers, jalapeños, or diced tomatoes.

**Tortilla tip**: Yellow corn tortillas have the best flavor and texture for tacos.
