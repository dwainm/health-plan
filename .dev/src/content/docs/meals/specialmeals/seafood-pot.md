## Method

### Build the Base
1. **Render bacon**: Cook slowly to release fat, until crispy
2. **Sauté vegetables**: In bacon fat, cook onions and peppers until soft
3. **Add mushrooms**: Cook until browned and reduced

### Create the Sauce
4. **Deglaze**: Add white wine, scrape bottom
5. **Add tomatoes**: Tomato smoor or crushed canned tomatoes
6. **Season**: Add all spices, stir well
7. **Simmer**: 10 minutes to meld flavors

### Cook Seafood (in order)
8. **Hard shells first**: Mussels and clams, cover 5 minutes until opened
9. **Prawns**: Add, cook 3 minutes until pink
10. **Calamari**: Add, cook 2 minutes
11. **White fish**: Gently nestle in, cook 3-4 minutes
12. **Soft shell**: Add pre-cooked crab/lobster at end just to warm
13. **Finish**: Stir in cream, heat through (don't boil)

### Serve
14. **Garnish**: Fresh parsley, lemon wedges
15. **Bread**: Essential for sauce

## Notes

- **Order matters**: Add seafood from longest-cooking to shortest
- **Don't overcook**: Seafood turns rubbery fast
- **Discard unopened mussels/clams** after cooking
- **Wine**: Use something you'd drink—cooking wine ruins the dish
- **Chakalaka soup**: Adds subtle heat, can omit for milder version

## Variations

| Style | Change |
|-------|--------|
| Portuguese | Add peri-peri, serve with rice |
| Italian | Add fennel, saffron, serve with linguine |
| Creamy | Increase cream to 1 cup |
| Tomato-forward | Double tomatoes, skip cream |
