# Principles

## 1. First Things First

> "Do everything as unto Him. This world will pass."

Health is stewardship, not obsession. We eat well to serve better, longer. The goal is faithfulness, not a magazine cover.

## 2. Calorie Density Is the Key

We don't count calories. We choose foods that fill us up with fewer calories automatically.

| Eat More (Low Density) | Eat Less (High Density) |
|------------------------|------------------------|
| Vegetables, fruits | Oil, butter |
| Starches (potatoes, rice, beans, whole grains) | Meat, cheese |
| Legumes, lentils | Processed snacks |
| Soups, stews | Fried foods |

**The result:** We eat until satisfied. The math takes care of itself.

## 3. Plant-Based by Default, Not by Doctrine

Our daily meals center on whole grains, legumes, vegetables, and starches.

Meat is not evil. It's a condiment, a celebration, a hospitality gesture—not the plate's center.

| Context | Approach |
|---------|----------|
| Daily family meals | Plant-based, starch-centered |
| Weekend braai | Enjoy meat, load up on salads |
| Pizza night | Thin crust, vegetable toppings |
| With friends | Eat what's served, grateful, no stress |

## 4. The 30 + 10 System

**Constraint is freedom.**

- **30 meals** for daily life — automatic, boring, effective
- **10 meals** for guests — special but not stressful

No more. New recipes only by deliberate choice, not impulse.

## 5. Resistance Training Over Cardio

For body composition (the six-pack goal):

| Activity | Purpose | Priority |
|----------|---------|----------|
| Resistance training | Build muscle, raise BMR | **First** |
| Cardio (running, swimming) | Heart health, enjoyment | Second |
| Daily movement | General health | Always |

Muscle burns calories at rest. Cardio burns calories only while doing it.

## 6. Whole Grains, Always

White flour and white rice aren't poison. They're just less filling.

| Choice | Result |
|--------|--------|
| Whole grain bread | 2 slices satisfied vs. 3-4 |
| Brown rice | Fuller, longer |
| Whole wheat pasta | More fiber, more satiety |

Same calories on paper. Fewer calories in practice.

## 7. Simplicity in Shopping

80% of our groceries are the same every week:

- Whole grains (oats, rice, whole wheat flour, pasta)
- Legumes (lentils, beans, chickpeas)
- Vegetables (seasonal, whatever looks good)
- Fruit
- Basic seasonings

We don't hunt exotic ingredients. We don't follow food trends.

## 8. Hospitality Without Compromise

When hosting:
- Serve food that honors guests
- Keep our defaults (vegetables, starches) as the base
- Add meat as a side option, not the main event
- Bread, wine, dessert—generosity satisfied, health preserved

When bringing food to others:
- Familiar, comforting, travels well
- No "health food" signals that make people nervous

## 9. The Long Game

We're not dieting. We're building a food culture.

In 5 years, healthy eating will be *normal*—not "that weird health phase."

## 10. Grace Over Perfection

Miss a day? Eat the wrong thing? Skip a workout?

Start again at the next meal. The next morning. No guilt, no making up, no spiral.

This is a direction, not a destination.
