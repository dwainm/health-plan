# Perfect Pressure Cooker Rice

The foundation. Fluffy, separate grains every time.

## Ingredients

| Ingredient | Amount |
|------------|--------|
| Rice (basmati or jasmine) | 2 cups |
| Water | 2 cups |
| Salt | 1½ tsp |

## Method

1. **Rinse** rice in cold water until water runs clear
2. **Soak** 15 minutes (optional—for extra fluffiness)
3. **Combine** rice, water, and salt in pressure cooker
4. **Cook** on LOW pressure for 3 minutes
5. **Rest** on "Keep Warm" for 10 minutes (do not open)
6. **Release** remaining steam manually
7. **Fluff** with fork and serve

## Variations

| Style | Modification |
|-------|--------------|
| Coconut rice | Replace ½ cup water with coconut milk |
| Herb rice | Add bay leaf, thyme, or cardamom pods before cooking |
| Turmeric rice | Add ½ tsp turmeric for color |

## Notes

- Ratio is 1:1 rice to water for pressure cooker (different from stovetop)
- Do not skip the 10-minute rest—finishes steaming
- Double recipe for guests (same timing)
