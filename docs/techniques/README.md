# Techniques

Foundational methods that support multiple meals. Not recipes—skills.

## The Basics

| Technique | Used In | Time |
|-----------|---------|------|
| [Pressure Cooker Rice](pressure-cooker-rice.md) | Curries, stir-fries, bowls | 20 min |
| [Dry Beans from Scratch](beans.md) | Soups, chilis, burritos | 45 min |
| [Quick Pickled Vegetables](pickles.md) | Bowls, sandwiches, sides | 15 min |
| [Roasted Vegetable Base](roasted-veg.md) | Bowls, soups, pasta | 30 min |

## Why Separate These?

These aren't meals. They're **building blocks**.

- Cook once, use all week
- Combine with any cuisine
- Reduce daily cooking time
- Make improvisation possible
