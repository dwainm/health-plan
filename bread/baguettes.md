# Whole Grain Baguettes

Same dough as our everyday loaf, shaped for guests and special meals.

## Why Baguettes

- **Portion control:** Smaller pieces, less overeating
- **Crust-to-crumb ratio:** More crispy crust per bite
- **Presentation:** Looks impressive, feels special
- **Braai companion:** Perfect for South African hospitality

## Ingredients

Same as [sourdough bread](sourdough-bread.md):

| Ingredient | Amount |
|------------|--------|
| Whole wheat flour | 800g |
| Bread flour | 200g |
| Water (warm) | 750g |
| Salt | 20g |
| Sourdough starter (active) | 200g |

## Timeline

Same through bulk fermentation. Shaping differs.

## Method

### Through Bulk Fermentation

Follow the [sourdough bread method](sourdough-bread.md) through step 3:
- Autolyse
- Add starter and salt
- Bulk fermentation with 4 sets of folds

### Pre-shape for Baguettes (4 hours from mixing)

Turn dough onto lightly floured counter.

Divide into **4 equal pieces** (for standard baguettes) or **6 pieces** (for smaller cocktail baguettes).

Gently pat each piece into a rectangle.

Fold top third down, seal with heel of hand.

Fold bottom third up, seal.

Roll gently from center outward to extend length.

Let rest 20-30 minutes, seam-side down.

### Final Shape

Take each rested log and roll again to extend:

- **Standard:** 35-40cm long
- **Cocktail:** 25-30cm long

Taper ends slightly.

Place on floured linen or parchment, pleating the cloth to support sides.

### Proof

Cover and let rise 1-2 hours at room temperature, **OR** refrigerate 8-12 hours for better flavor and scoring.

### Score and Bake

**Preheat:**
- Oven to 250°C (480°F)
- Baking stone or steel inside
- Small pan for steam on bottom rack

**Prepare:**
- Transfer baguettes to parchment or floured peel
- Score with lame or sharp razor: **3-5 overlapping slashes** at 45° angle

**Bake:**
- Slide onto hot stone/steel
- Pour 1 cup hot water into steam pan (careful!)
- Close door quickly
- 20 minutes with steam
- Remove steam pan, reduce to 230°C (450°F)
- 10-15 minutes more until deep golden

**Cool:**
- On wire rack at least 30 minutes
- Baguettes are best eaten same day

## The Steam Challenge

Without professional steam injection, options:

| Method | How |
|--------|-----|
| Dutch oven (small loaves) | Bake 2 mini-baguettes covered, then uncovered |
| Steam pan | Metal pan on bottom rack, add boiling water at start |
| Ice cubes | Toss 5-6 ice cubes on preheated sheet pan |
| Spray bottle | Mist oven walls (avoid light bulb) at start |

## Storage

Baguettes stale quickly. Plan to eat same day.

| Option | Method |
|--------|--------|
| Same day | Paper bag, room temp |
| Next day | Revive in 200°C oven 5 minutes |
| Freeze | Wrap well, freeze same day, reheat from frozen |

## Serving Suggestions

| Occasion | Presentation |
|----------|--------------|
| Braai | Basket with olive oil for dipping |
| Dinner party | Sliced, with hummus or tapenade |
| Soup meal | Whole, torn at table |
| Breakfast | Toasted, with butter and jam |

## Family Notes

- **Cocktail size** is easier to handle
- **Same-day bake** is non-negotiable for texture
- **Freeze extra** if not eating all—don't let them stale
- Weekend project: make dough Saturday, bake Sunday morning
